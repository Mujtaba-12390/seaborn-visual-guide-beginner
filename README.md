### What is Seaborn?

Seaborn is a powerful Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. This guide serves as an introduction to Seaborn, covering everything from its basics to advanced customization.

## Advantages of Seaborn

### Why Seaborn?

- **Aesthetic Visuals:** Seaborn comes with beautiful default styles and color palettes, making your visualizations both informative and visually appealing.
- **Built-in Themes:** Easily switch between different themes to adapt your visualizations to the context of your data.
- **Statistical Estimation:** Seaborn simplifies the process of including statistical estimation within your plots, providing deeper insights into your data.

## Utilizing `sns`

### Unraveling the Power of `sns`

In this guide, we explore the `sns` module extensively. From basic plotting functions to advanced features, you'll learn how to leverage the full potential of Seaborn with ease.

## Different Plots

### Plotting Beyond the Basics

Explore a variety of plots, including:
- Univariate Plots
- Bivariate Plots
- Categorical Plots
- Distribution Plots
- Matrix Plots

Each section includes hands-on examples to solidify your understanding.

## Relational Plots and Subplots

### Mastering Complex Visualizations

Delve into the intricacies of relational plots and subplot arrangements. Learn how to present complex data relationships in an understandable and visually appealing manner.

## Customization

### Tailoring Plots to Your Needs

Discover the art of customization, from changing colors and styles to modifying plot aesthetics. Make your visualizations uniquely yours.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code samples in this guide, ensure you have Python installed. You can install the required packages using:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

**1. Clone the Repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Mujtaba-12390//player-analysis-Babar-Azam.git
```
**2. Install Dependencies:**
Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using:
```
pip install jupyter
```
**3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
```
jupyter notebook
```
**4. New way to kick-start**
How to kick-start a data science project

Old way ðŸ¥´
- import libraries you'll need
- dealing with import-related errors
- search the correct import statement on Google

(repeat the cycle, depending on the project's complexity)

New way ðŸ¤“
- pip install pyforest

PyForet gives you an unfair advantage to jumpstart any data science projects
With just one line of code, you can import the 40 most commonly used Python libraries
Libraries are loaded on-demand, consuming memory space only when a specific function or method is invoked
This saves you time and ensures that your code doesn't slow down due to unnecessary imports
I can't believe I wasted so much time hunting down imports statements!

**5. Install all Python libraries:**
You must install Python and its libraries. If not, you can install it using:
```
pip install pyforest

```
